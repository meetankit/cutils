 * 
 *         This class, along with AbstractRowConsumer, provides a way to speed
 *         up processing of rows produced by a producer, when the processing is
 *         a bottleneck.
 * 
 *         Expected usage is as follows: the producer keeps adding rows to
 *         RowBuffer shared by the consuming (processing) threads. The shared
 *         RowBuffer is initialized and passed to the consumer.
 * 
 *         The main value of this class is to buffer rows in batches of maximum
 *         size (as specified to the constructor), in a way that minimizes
 *         synchronization bottlenecks. The maximum batch size should be chosen
 *         to be small (compared to the total number of rows) to ensure an even
 *         distribution of work across all the consuming threads. At the same
 *         time, it should be large enough so that each consuming thread has a
 *         sizable amount of work to do and spends a small fraction of its time
 *         polling for new work - that will depend on the nature of processing.
